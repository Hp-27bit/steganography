# Steganography Demo Script

## Pre-Demo Preparation
- Ensure application is running locally at http://localhost:5000
- Prepare 2-3 sample images in PNG format:
  - A landscape photo
  - A colorful abstract image
  - A simple logo or icon
- Test all features beforehand
- Have backup images in case of technical issues
- Check internet connection if showing online resources

## Introduction (30 seconds)
"Now I'll demonstrate our steganography application in action. You'll see how we can hide messages within ordinary images with no visible changes to the human eye."

## Demo Walkthrough

### 1. Encoding a Message (2 minutes)

#### Step 1: Access the application
"First, I'll open our web application running locally. As you can see, we have a clean, intuitive interface with options for encoding and decoding."

#### Step 2: Select an image
"I'll select this landscape photo. The application supports PNG images because they use lossless compression, which is essential for preserving our hidden data."

#### Step 3: Enter the message
"Now I'll type a secret message: 'This message is hidden in plain sight. Steganography is powerful technology for covert communication.'"

#### Step 4: Set a password
"For additional security, I'll add a password: 'demo2023'. This ensures that even if someone suspects there's a hidden message, they can't extract it without the password."

#### Step 5: Process the image
"When I click 'Encode', the application processes the image, embedding our message using the LSB technique we discussed earlier."

#### Step 6: Show the result
"Here's our output image. Notice how it looks identical to the original. I'll download this image so we can use it for decoding."

### 2. Decoding a Message (2 minutes)

#### Step 1: Switch to decode mode
"Now let's extract our hidden message. I'll switch to the 'Decode' tab."

#### Step 2: Upload the steganographic image
"I'll upload the image we just created with the hidden message."

#### Step 3: Enter the password
"Now I need to enter the same password: 'demo2023'."

#### Step 4: Extract the message
"When I click 'Decode', the application analyzes the image, extracts the LSBs, and reconstructs our message."

#### Step 5: Show the extracted message
"As you can see, the message has been successfully extracted: 'This message is hidden in plain sight. Steganography is powerful technology for covert communication.'"

### 3. Demonstration of Security Features (1 minute)

#### Step 1: Wrong password attempt
"What happens if we try to decode with the wrong password? Let me try with 'wrongpass'..."

*[Show the error message or incorrect output]*

"As expected, without the correct password, the message remains secure."

#### Step 2: Image format importance
"Let me also demonstrate why image format matters. If I save our steganographic image as a JPEG and try to decode it..."

*[Show the failed decoding attempt]*

"The JPEG compression has destroyed our hidden data, which illustrates why we use PNG format."

## Conclusion (30 seconds)
"This demonstration shows how our application successfully implements steganography to hide and retrieve secret messages within digital images. The process is straightforward for users while maintaining security through password protection and proper image handling."

## Handling Q&A
- Be prepared for questions about:
  - Maximum message length
  - Image size limitations
  - Detection possibilities
  - Comparison with encryption
