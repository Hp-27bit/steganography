# Steganography Project Presentation Outline

## 1. Introduction (2-3 minutes)
- Title slide: "Image Steganography: Hiding Messages in Plain Sight"
- Brief self-introduction and project context
- Definition of steganography: "The art and science of hiding information within other information"
- Why it matters: Privacy, security, and digital communication

## 2. Project Overview (3-4 minutes)
- Project goals and objectives
- Key features implemented:
  - Encoding text messages in images
  - Encryption for additional security
  - Web interface for accessibility
- Technologies used: Python, Flask, PIL (Pillow), cryptography libraries

## 3. Steganography Explained (4-5 minutes)
- Basic principles of digital images (pixels, RGB values)
- LSB (Least Significant Bit) technique:
  - Visual explanation with pixel examples
  - How changing the LSB is virtually undetectable
- Demonstrate with a simple before/after image example
- Brief history/context of steganography techniques

## 4. Technical Implementation (5-6 minutes)
- Architecture diagram of the system
- Encoding process:
  - Converting text to binary
  - Modifying LSBs in image pixels
  - How message length is handled
- Decoding process:
  - Extracting LSBs from pixels
  - Converting binary back to text
- Encryption layer:
  - Password-based encryption
  - How it adds an extra security layer

## 5. Live Demo (4-5 minutes)
- Walk through the web interface
- Demonstrate encoding a message into an image
- Show the resulting image (visually identical to the original)
- Demonstrate decoding with the correct password
- Show what happens with incorrect password

## 6. Technical Challenges (3-4 minutes)
- Image format considerations (why PNG is preferred)
- Handling color channels effectively
- Balancing message capacity with image quality
- Encryption implementation challenges

## 7. Security Analysis (3-4 minutes)
- Strengths of the implementation
- Potential vulnerabilities
- How the encryption strengthens the security
- Comparison with other steganography approaches

## 8. Future Enhancements (2-3 minutes)
- Support for other file types (audio, video)
- More advanced steganography algorithms
- Mobile application development
- Advanced encryption options

## 9. Conclusion (2 minutes)
- Summary of key achievements
- Lessons learned during development
- Potential real-world applications
- Acknowledgments

## 10. Q&A Session (as needed)
- Prepare answers for technical questions about:
  - Algorithm details
  - Security considerations
  - Implementation choices
  - Potential improvements

## Visual Aids to Include:
- Diagrams showing how LSB steganography works
- Before/after images with hidden messages
- Code snippets highlighting key algorithms
- System architecture diagram
- Performance metrics (if available)
- Comparison with other steganography methods

## Demo Instructions:
1. Prepare 2-3 images and sample messages in advance
2. Ensure all web components are functioning properly
3. Have a backup demo video in case of technical issues
4. Prepare sample passwords and show both successful and failed decoding
