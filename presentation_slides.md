# Image Steganography: Hiding Messages in Plain Sight

---

## What is Steganography?

> "The art and science of hiding information within other information"

* Conceals the existence of the message
* Different from encryption (which only hides the meaning)
* Ancient practice, modern digital applications
* Provides privacy and security in digital communication

## Project Overview

**Key Features:**
* Encode text messages in images
* Password-based encryption
* Web interface for accessibility
* Secure message extraction

**Technologies Used:**
* Python + Flask for web framework
* PIL (Pillow) for image processing
* Cryptography libraries for encryption
* HTML/CSS/JS for frontend

## How Digital Images Work

* Images are made of pixels
* Each pixel contains RGB values (0-255)
* Example pixel: (124, 65, 232)
* Minor changes to these values are invisible to the human eye

## LSB Steganography Explained

**Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique:**

Original pixel: (124, 65, 232)  
In binary: (01111100, 01000001, 11101000)

Modified LSB: (01111100, 01000000, 11101001)  
New pixel: (124, 64, 233)

*Can you see the difference?*

## Encoding Process

```
1. Convert text message to binary
2. Read image pixel by pixel
3. Replace LSB of each color channel with message bits
4. Add encryption layer with password
5. Save as new image (visually identical)
```

## Decoding Process

```
1. Read steganographic image pixel by pixel
2. Extract LSBs from each color channel
3. Convert binary data back to text
4. Decrypt using provided password
5. Display original message
```

## Live Demo

**Let's see it in action:**
1. Uploading an image
2. Entering a message and password
3. Viewing the steganographic image
4. Extracting the hidden message

## Technical Challenges

* PNG format preferred (lossless compression)
* JPEG compression destroys hidden data
* Message capacity limited by image size
* Balancing stealth vs. data capacity
* Handling encryption securely

## Security Analysis

**Strengths:**
* Visually undetectable
* Password encryption adds security layer
* Web interface limits access

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**
* Statistical analysis
* Pixel pattern analysis
* Known-plaintext attacks

## Future Enhancements

* Support for audio and video steganography
* Advanced algorithms (DCT, wavelet-based)
* Mobile app development
* Blockchain integration for verification
* Multiple encryption options

## Applications

* Secure communications
* Digital watermarking
* Privacy protection
* Data authentication
* Covert communication channels
